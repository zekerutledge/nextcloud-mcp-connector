"""The parameter names an audit entry may carry, one frozen set per tool.

This file names names and never values: it says which argument *names* of a tool call may
appear in an entry, and nothing here can say what was in one of them (D-06, T-18-01). It is
data only, and that is the second half of its job: no line reads a value, no function takes
an argument out of a request, because there is no function here at all. The boundary itself
is held by ``tests/contract/test_audit_surface.py``, which measures this list against the
live tool surface rather than trusting that both were kept in step by hand.

#: set above. ``content`` and ``content_base64`` on ``files_upload``, ``content`` on
#: ``notes_create`` and ``message`` on
#: ``talk_send`` are the clear three (18-RESEARCH.md:428-433): that a body was handed along
#: is trivially true for a write tool, so the name carries no information at all and would
#: stand in the entry for one reason only, to grow a value next to it one day by accident.
#: ``description``, ``location``, ``summary``, ``title`` and ``values`` join for exactly the
#: same reason: they are the payload fields of ``calendar_create_event``, ``deck_create_card``,
#: ``notes_create`` and ``tables_create_row``, the text a person typed, and the presence of
