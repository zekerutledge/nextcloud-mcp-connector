"""The constrained-mutation promise, enforced by a gate instead of by discipline.

The server has one approved destructive request: revision-bound deletion of an individual file.
Every other delete, overwrite, move, copy, property change, or share mutation remains forbidden.

Two things make this test trustworthy rather than decorative:

*   **Comments and docstrings are removed before counting.** ``clients/dav.py`` explains in
    its module docstring that it implements no DELETE, no MOVE, no COPY and no PROPPATCH.
    A naive grep would fail on that sentence, and the usual repair is to delete the
    sentence, which trades documentation for a green check. String literals stay in scope
    on purpose: ``method="DELETE"`` is the real thing this gate is looking for.
*   **Every finding names file and line**, so a violation is a one line fix and never a
    hunt through the tree.

The same parsing gives two more guarantees for free: no module level mutable state that
could act as a session store (D-20), and no tool that stops to ask the user mid call.

# Destructive HTTP verbs and the one OCS route that changes who may see an object. Upper
# case on purpose: httpx spells a custom method in upper case, and the lower case words
# "move" or "copy" occur in ordinary prose and identifiers.
#
# The five Tables entries at the end are a different kind of needle: they carry no
# forbidden verb, because a POST on a single row route changes that row and a POST on a
# scheme route rewrites a whole table. The verb alone would let all of that through, so
# these name the route instead.
#
# All five are anchored on a **path segment**, not on the opening quote of a literal. An
# earlier version used ``'"/columns/'`` and ``"tables/scheme"``, and the project's own way of
# writing a path walked straight past both of them: a column write reads
# ``f"{V2_PREFIX}/columns/{column_id}"`` and never opens a literal with that segment, and a
# per table scheme export reads ``f"{V2_PREFIX}/tables/{table}/scheme"`` and never puts the
# two words next to each other. The integration tests of this phase build their scaffolding
# routes in exactly that spelling, so the gap was not hypothetical (WR-05). Anchoring on the
# segment costs two exemptions instead, for the two reads the family exists for, and those
# are named as exact literals below.
#
# The ten Talk entries after them are the same kind of needle for a family that needs it more
# than any other, and the reason is a verb that is missing from this list: **PUT** is not
# forbidden in this project, because ``files_upload`` is a PUT. A route that edits a message
# therefore falls through every verb needle there is, and a route that hands a message to the
# app for later delivery ("/schedule") would even walk past the administrative send switch of
# TALK-04, because the app, not this server, would do the sending. So this family is secured
# from both sides: the ten segments below, each with its own counter proof in
# :data:`TALK_ROUTES`, and :data:`ALLOWED_TALK_ROUTES` as the positive statement about the
# exactly three path forms the Talk client really builds.
#
# ``/share`` already stands above and needs no second entry: the attachment route of Talk is
# ``chat/{token}/share``, so the Tables needle covers it. An eleventh needle beside it would
# only look like more security.
#
# The nine Mail entries at the end are the same kind of needle for the family that needs it
# most, and the reason is a route that lies next door to a read: the Mail app declares exactly
# one send path, ``/apps/mail/message/send``, and the full message read is
# ``/apps/mail/message/{id}``. The two share the segment ``/message/`` and only ``send``
# separates them, so the needle has to be the longer segment and the counter proof in
# :data:`MAIL_ROUTES` is what shows that it still hits. The eight ``/api/...`` entries beside
# it are the internal resource routes of the app's own frontend, which this server
# deliberately never builds (see the module docstring of ``clients/mail.py``): a POST there
# creates, a PUT changes and a DELETE removes on the very path a read would use, and no verb
# needle can tell those four apart. ``/api/outbox`` is the second way to send in that app and
# carries no ``send`` in its path at all.
#
# Two needles that already stand above reach into the Mail family without anything being done
# about it, and neither of them gets a second entry beside the nine: ``/attachment`` forbids
# the Mail attachment route the same way it forbids the Talk one, and ``/read`` forbids
# ``/api/mailboxes/{id}/read``, which ``/api/mailboxes`` covers a second time anyway. A tenth
# and eleventh Mail needle for those two would only look like more security.
#
# :data:`ALLOWED_MAIL_ROUTES` is the other half of the proof, and it matters more here than
# for Talk: PUT and POST are allowed verbs in this project, so a needle can never say which
# path forms are meant to exist. That list says it out loud, with the four the client builds.
