"""GATE-01: every tool of the live registry stands in exactly one class, with a reason.

The table lives in ``tool_classes.py`` (D-28-02) and is compared with the tools the running
server object lists, not with a literal of this file: a new tool such as ``files_update``
(issue #9) fails here the day it is registered, before the canary and the pair tests could
silently miss it. The counter proofs go through the same ``freeze_findings`` as the gate,
because a counter proof that reimplements the check proves something about the counter proof.
