"""File tools: finding, browsing, reading, creating, editing, moving, and deleting files.

Three guards protect the model's context window and the user's data (threat T-01-13):
the path guard runs before any request, ``files_read`` refuses binary content instead of
shipping base64, and the size cap turns a large read into a marked slice with a
``next_offset`` instead of a multi-megabyte answer.

The binary download path has a per-response size ceiling and a continuation offset. It
returns an MCP embedded resource instead of putting base64 into a text answer, so a capable
client can save or forward the file without feeding its bytes to the model.

The two list tools add another guard: every answer that had to stop early says so with
``truncated`` and hands out a cursor handle, so a folder with ten thousand entries costs
one page, not one context window (threat T-01-34).

``upload`` can only create. ``edit`` replaces one existing ``.md`` or ``.txt`` revision,
with a 32 KiB UTF-8 ceiling and an exact read-back. ``move`` relocates one file with collision
refusal. Both mutation paths bind to the source ETag and permit one retry only after inspection
proves an ambiguous first request did not take effect. ``delete`` remains one-file-only,
revision-bound, approval-oriented, and non-retrying.
