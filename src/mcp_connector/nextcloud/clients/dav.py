"""WebDAV client: bounded reads, guarded writes, file moves, and individual deletion.

Create-only PUTs carry ``If-None-Match: *``. Text edits carry the immediately observed ETag in
``If-Match`` and require an exact read-back. User-facing MOVE carries the source ETag and
``Overwrite: F``; it verifies source absence and destination file identity. Edit and move may
retry once only after an ambiguous transport failure and only when inspection proves the first
request did not take effect. File deletion remains revision-bound and never retries. No tool
exposes copy, property editing, destination overwrite, or recursive folder deletion.

Status handling follows two rules from the research: never repeat a failed
authentication (Nextcloud counts failures per source IP and slows down every user of the
server afterwards), and never let a redirect pass silently (the auth header would go to a
foreign host or vanish).
