"""The classification of every tool against the ``kein-ki`` guard; a data module, not a test.

Every registered tool stands in exactly one of three classes (D-28-01): it reads files, it
writes into the file surface, or it is not affected. Each entry carries one sentence of
reason with a ``file:line`` anchor (D-28-03), explicitly also every "not affected", because
an empty "not affected" is exactly the claim a reviewer cannot check.

One truth for three gates: the freeze in ``test_tool_classes.py`` compares this table with
the live registry of ``mcp_connector.server.mcp`` (D-28-02), and the canary and the pair
tests of phase 28 import the same table instead of keeping their own list. A second copy
would be a second truth, and the day the two disagree nobody notices.

Why a module and not ``conftest.py``: ``tests/conftest.py`` imports nothing from
``mcp_connector`` on purpose, and a fixture there would reach every test layer. This module
is imported by name; ``pyproject.toml`` puts ``tests/contract`` on the import path for it.
