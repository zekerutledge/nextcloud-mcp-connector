"""Contract test for the tool surface exposed over MCP.

RED on purpose in plan 01-01: ``mcp_connector.server`` does not exist yet. Plan 01-02
delivers the walking skeleton (``files_read`` over stdio) and turns this file green.
Plan 01-14 closes the phase and widens the file to the full surface: the section
"the whole surface at once" below checks all tools in one pass instead of one
vertical at a time, so a new tool, a wrong annotation, a stray output schema or a
user parameter cannot slip in between two plans.

The sixteenth tool, ``prepare_context``, arrived in plan 04-02 and had to be entered here
on purpose: the frozen literal below refused it until then, which is exactly the job of
this file (D-58). The Tables pair of plan 08-04 and the Talk pair of plan 09-04 went through
the same door, and with them every other frozen number of this file, which is why they are
named in one place.
